# Architecture

Current-state reference for Damson. The build-time design docs in
[`docs/archive/`](archive/) describe the *why* and the trade-offs;
this doc describes *what is in the tree today*.

Companions:

- [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) — coding standards, handler
  patterns, test helpers
- [`docs/design-system.md`](design-system.md) — frontend design system
- [`docs/progress.md`](progress.md) — milestone-by-milestone status
- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — quick-start guidance for agentic coding

## 1. What Damson is

A self-hosted digital asset manager for game-development assets.
Single Go binary that embeds a React SPA, fronted by a reverse proxy,
backed by Postgres and an S3-compatible object store (or a local
filesystem for single-node installs).

Core concerns:

- **Library-based group ownership** — a `libraries` row is the tenancy
  boundary. Users gain access via `library_memberships`; within a
  library, every member sees the same data.
- **Content-addressed storage** — file bytes live keyed by SHA-256.
  Postgres holds metadata; the same texture appearing in five packages
  occupies one object.
- **Versioning is immutable** — an `AssetVersion`'s file manifest is
  fixed once written. Re-extractions produce new versions.
- **Projects are declarative** — a project pins specific versions;
  upgrade is a logged, reversible action.
- **Audit is a boundary** — every library-scoped write writes an
  `audit_log` row in the same DB transaction.

The MVP is M0–M7; see [`docs/progress.md`](progress.md) for what has
landed, what is partial, and what is deferred.
